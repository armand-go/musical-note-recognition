# musical-note-recognition
Project made during 2nd year of preparatory class as part of my education

## Purpose of the project

During my second year of preparatory class at ISEP, Paris, we still had to achieve a project which put in practise our mathematical and/or physical skills. This time, I teamed up with a friend which is fond of music and piano. This project was his idea and we developped it during one year.

## Specifications

This project was written in **Python**.
We were both more at ease with Pyhton as we learnt it during the 1st year, and that this langage is far more comprehensible and simple to implement compared to other. Plus, there were much more ressources available so we could easily find answers to our problems.
The project is composed of a graphical interface, generated with QtUI, as we didn't want to loose too much time on the conception of this latter.


## Content

This repo contains all the documents I had to give in at the end of the project :

- The code (of course) needed to run the algorithm
- The report that explains all our approach and research to create the algorithm.
- The .pptx used during the presentation
